- lillie, a machine that gives old comments their second coming
    This is something I wrote at an evening and will never maintain.
    Reaps karma and wastes reddit servers' time.
    I'm still a little proud of it.

- a rather technical blueprint in pseudo-haskell
    findNewFrontpagePosts >>= (\post ->
      zip post (findResubmittableContent post)
    ) >>= filter seenPost >>= post

    That about sums it up.

- requirements
    redditkit.rb, ruby

- issues
    It doesn't typecheck, because ruby has no types.
    It doesn't have tests, because it would be a large bitch to test...
    Its repost search goodness criteria is too high.
    It doesn't use the latest redditkit.rb(probably)

- usage
    #<s>./lillie user password</s>
    echo Please don't use it, it will make reddit cancer.
